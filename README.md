# E-Commerce-Recommendation-System


### Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a recommendation system that provides personalized product suggestions to users based on their interaction history, preferences, and product attributes. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), the system enhances user experiences across e-commerce platforms by predicting user preferences and recommending relevant products.

### Problem Statement

In the competitive landscape of e-commerce, providing personalized recommendations is crucial for enhancing user engagement and conversion rates. This project seeks to address the challenge of recommending products effectively based on user behavior and product attributes.

### Types of Recommendation Systems

1. Collaborative Filtering:
   - Analyzes user behaviors to identify similarities among users or items, recommending products based on these patterns.

2. Content-Based Filtering:
   - Recommends items similar to those the user has previously liked, based on the features of the items.

3. Hybrid Systems:
   - Combines collaborative and content-based approaches to enhance recommendation accuracy and overcome the limitations of each individual method.

### Objectives

The project aims to:
- Provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and interaction history.
- Increase user engagement and conversion rates for retailers.
- Improve customer satisfaction by suggesting relevant products based on historical data.

### Methodology

**Data Collection and Exploration:**
- The dataset has been collected from Kaggle, featuring electronic product listings from various e-commerce websites. It includes essential details such as product names, brands, categories, prices, availability, condition, and merchant information.

**Challenges in Dataset Selection:**
- Data Quality: Missing or incorrect values can undermine the reliability of recommendations.
- Outdated Information: Rapid changes in the electronic market can lead to obsolete datasets, resulting in irrelevant recommendations.
- Feature Relevance: Irrelevant features can introduce noise, reducing the accuracy of the recommendation model.
